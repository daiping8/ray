# Ray Go E2E Drivers

This directory contains end-to-end (E2E) integration test cases for the Ray Go
runtime. They run against a local Ray cluster to verify the core functionality
of the Go runtime and serve as reference for further development.

## E2E cases

Every case is submitted to a local Ray cluster as a standalone driver binary.
The common flow:

```bash
# 1. Build the userfuncs plugin
bazel build //go/e2e/userfuncs/plugin:userfuncs_plugin

# 2. Build the target driver
bazel build //go/e2e/driver_app          # example; replace the target name per case

# 3. Prepare the run directory (plugin and driver in the same directory)
mkdir -p job_dir
cp bazel-bin/go/e2e/userfuncs/plugin/userfuncs.so job_dir/
cp bazel-bin/go/e2e/driver_app_/driver_app job_dir/

# 4. Submit as a Ray job
cd job_dir && ray job submit --working-dir . -- ./driver_app
```

| Driver | Build target | What it verifies |
|---|---|---|
| `driver_app` | `//go/e2e/driver_app` | Remote task submission, Free API, GetActorHandle; supports `--run-mode=local` local mode |
| `actor_integration_driver` | `//go/e2e/actor_integration_driver` | Actor lifecycle, instance isolation, void/multiple returns, named tasks, concurrency groups (`_ray_system` and `ActorCreator.WithConcurrencyGroups` declared group `cg_go_add` downlink + task-level routing), Exit/Kill, creation options (lifetime/async/maxPendingCalls, spec 2.1), handle.kill instance method (spec 2.3) |
| `driver_parallel_actor` | `//go/e2e/driver_parallel_actor` | Parallel Actor concurrency-group model (aligned with Java `io.ray.api.parallelactor`): `NewParallelActor` creates N PARALLEL_INSTANCE_&lt;i&gt; concurrency groups, `GetInstance(i).Task(...).Remote()` instance routing, inter-instance state isolation, intra-instance state retention, and the inter-instance parallel / intra-instance serial concurrency semantics |
| `driver_call_python` | `//go/e2e/driver_call_python` | Go->Python cross-language function calls and actors (needs `test_go_call_python.py` in the same directory) |
| `driver_call_cpp` | `//go/e2e/driver_call_cpp` | Go->C++ cross-language calls (spec 10.2/10.5): RemoteCpp/RemoteCppVoid/cross-language types (including struct)/C++ Actor + CppFunctionDescriptor (the C++ Worker must register the corresponding functions/Actor; see `driver_call_cpp/README.md`) |
| `runtime_context_driver` | `//go/e2e/runtime_context_driver` | Full RuntimeContext API and GetAvailableResourceIds/GetGpuIds (spec 6.1/8.1) |
| `global_state_accessor_driver` | `//go/e2e/global_state_accessor_driver` | GlobalStateAccessor production-implementation queries + actor list filtered by state (ALIVE/DEAD) pushed down (spec 12.3/12.5) |
| `runtime_env_driver` | `//go/e2e/runtime_env_driver` | Full user-side RuntimeEnv API flow + submission via WithRuntimeEnv verified to take effect in the worker (spec 7.1) + Autoscaler status-report loop ReportAutoscalingState->GetAutoscalerStatus (spec 12.4) |
| `driver_placement_group` | `//go/e2e/driver_placement_group` | Placement Group user API (spec 4.1/4.2/3.1): lifecycle (create/wait/get/getByName/getAll/remove, state migrates to Removed after removal), tasks/Actor bound to bundles via `WithPlacementGroup` (the call.go main downlink path), option validation; `--run-mode=local` covers local change simulation and not-supported queries (AC8) |
| `driver_gcs_client` | `//go/e2e/driver_gcs_client` | User-side GCSClient extension (spec 12.1/12.6): `GetGCSClient()` + PG queries x3 (including by-name and REMOVED after removal) + InternalKV write/read-back round trip + Node/Actor queries (including ALIVE state filtering); local mode returns not-supported |
| `driver_metrics` | `//go/e2e/driver_metrics` | User Metrics API (spec 13.1): RegisterTagKey + Count/Gauge/Sum/Histogram register/Record/Unregister + handle rejection after unregister; local mode returns not-supported (AC14) |
| `zero_copy_benchmark` | `//go/e2e/zero_copy_benchmark` | Cross-process zero-copy Get performance benchmark (local/cross, 4MB/64MB) |

## userfuncs shared function package

`userfuncs/` is the shared user-function package for the E2E cases, compiled to
the `userfuncs.so` plugin that the Go worker loads. Drivers point the plugin
out through JobConfig's `code_search_path`, and the worker resolves function and
actor descriptors from it.

## Lockstep and the packaging hash gate

The raygo CLI and `go_runtime.so` must be deployed in lockstep: both are built
from the same Go tree, and the packaging step verifies the hash of the
`raygo`/`go_runtime.so` pair so a mismatched combination is rejected at package
time. Note that the packaging hash gate covers only the raygo/go_runtime.so
pair — aligning a `userfuncs.so` plugin with the runtime is a manual deployment
step (keep the plugin and the runtime built from the same tree).

## Prerequisites

1. A local Ray cluster (`ray start --head`) — required for driver mode.
2. The `raygo` binary must exist (packaged under `python/ray/go/cmd/raygo` or on
   `PATH`). When present, the Go worker command is injected automatically; no
   extra environment variable is needed.
3. The `userfuncs.so` plugin must use an absolute path (`code_search_path`),
   otherwise the worker-side `os.Stat` fails and the functions are not
   registered.
4. `runtime_env_driver` depends on newer runtime capabilities (RuntimeEnv API
   7.1 / Autoscaler report 12.4); site-packages must have the latest
   `ray/go/lib/go_runtime.so` and `ray/go/cmd/raygo` synced (`bazel run
   //go:gen_ray_go_pkg` then sync), otherwise the plugin version mismatch or a
   missing method causes a runtime failure.

Optional: `RAY_ENABLE_GO_SETUP_WORKER=1` makes the worker startup preamble for
all languages (PYTHON/CPP/JAVA/GO) use the Go implementation
(`raygo setup_worker`) instead of the default Python `setup_worker.py`. It only
affects the setup implementation, not worker command injection.

## Manual run form

These drivers are manual targets: build them with `bazel build //go/e2e/<target>`
and run them against a real cluster via `ray job submit`. They are not wired
into CI. The two pytest scripts (`test_go_call_python.py` and
`test_python_call_go_simple.py`) are manual real-machine lanes for
cross-language verification.

## Troubleshooting

**1. Build fails: dependency not found**
```
Make sure you have run: bazel run //go:gazelle
```

**2. userfuncs.so not found at runtime**
```
First build the plugin: bazel build //go/e2e/userfuncs/plugin:userfuncs_plugin
and copy the .so file into the driver's directory (uploaded via --working-dir)
```

**3. Worker reports "function not registered"**
```
code_search_path must be an absolute path; or use RAY_GO_USERFUNC_SO to point
at the absolute .so path
```

**4. Cannot connect to the Ray cluster**
```
- Confirm Ray is running: ray start --head --port=6379
- Check the environment variable: echo $RAY_ADDRESS
- Or test with driver_app's local mode: ./driver_app --run-mode=local
```

### Overriding the plugin search path

`raygo` resolves `go_runtime.so` from an explicit `RAY_GO_RUNTIME_PATH`
environment variable first, then falls back to a multi-tier search that can
consult the Python installation. A stale Go build under `~/.local` can shadow
the intended runtime and break every subcommand with a plugin-loadability
error; when in doubt, set `RAY_GO_RUNTIME_PATH` to the exact `go_runtime.so`
so the deployment is pinned (the packaging hash gate covers only the
raygo/go_runtime.so pair).
