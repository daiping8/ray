"""Recursive conversion of Python objects into msgpack-native types.

pydantic v1 ``.dict()`` recursively converts nested BaseModel/list/dict but
leaves str-Enum members as Enum objects (e.g.
``TrainRun.dict()["status"]`` is ``<RunStatus.RUNNING: 'RUNNING'>``), and the
serve instance details dict likewise embeds ``ServeDeployMode`` /
``ApplicationStatus`` / ``APIType`` enums. The msgpack ``strict_types``
serializer rejects Enum instances, which forces the Python serializer fallback
that the Go cross-language deserializer cannot read ("msgpack: unknown ext
id=101"). This module recursively reduces any value to msgpack-native types
(dict/list/str/int/float/bool/bytes/None) by converting every Enum to its
value and every pydantic BaseModel to its ``.dict()``.
